<p class="note warning">
<strong>WARNING! </strong>
The PRODUCT-NAME for PCF tile is currently in beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. 
Do not use this product in a PCF production environment.
</p>

**This topic begins with a brief description of what the product tile (e.g. Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF) does, 
whereas the Overview section below describes what the service itself (e.g. Apigee Edge) does. See below for an example.**

This documentation describes the Apigee Edge Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). The Apigee Edge Service 
Broker for PCF enables developers to manage APIs for their PCF apps through the Apigee Edge management console.

**Note**: This description will appear under **OVERVIEW** in the tile's listing on 
[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

**The overview describes the service that your product offers to PCF developers. 
Make sure to overview the features of the integration.
Don't focus only on the overview of your product that is being integrated.
See below for an example.**

The Apigee Edge Service Broker for PCF registers a service broker with PCF and exposes its service plans on the 
Marketplace. Developers can then create service plan instances using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command 
Line Interface (cf CLI) and bind them to their apps.

Creating an Apigee Edge for PCF service instance and binding it to an app creates an Apigee Edge API proxy that 
handles requests for the app. This lets developers use the Apigee Edge management console to manage API request 
handling between clients and the app.

**Note**: This overview will appear under **OVERVIEW**, combined with the description above in the tile's listing on 
[Pivotal Network](http://network.pivotal.io).
